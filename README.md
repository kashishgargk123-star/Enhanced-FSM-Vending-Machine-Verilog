# Enhanced FSM-Based Smart Vending Machine Controller using Verilog HDL

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **Enhanced Smart Vending Machine Controller** using **Verilog HDL** based on the **Moore Finite State Machine (FSM)** architecture.

The vending machine accepts ₹5 and ₹10 coins and provides additional real-world functionalities such as **transaction cancellation**, **refund**, and **change return**. The design has been functionally verified using a dedicated Verilog testbench and simulated with **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**.

## ⚙️ FSM States

| State | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| S0 | Idle state (Waiting for coins) |
| S5 | ₹5 inserted |
| DISPENSE | Dispenses the product |
| CHANGE | Dispenses product and returns ₹5 change |
| REFUND | Returns inserted money after cancel request |

---

## 🧪 Test Cases Verified

✔ Reset Operation

✔ ₹10 Coin → Product Dispensed

✔ ₹5 + ₹5 → Product Dispensed

✔ ₹5 + ₹10 → Product Dispensed + ₹5 Change

✔ ₹5 + Cancel → Refund

✔ Idle State Verification
